Initial commit is the initial state of the project from Codecademy "Full-Stack Engineer" Path.

During this lesson I got to know how: 

- Use the *Route* component to add routes to the application
- Use the *Route* component’s **path** prop to specify static routes (those without URL parameters, eg. /users) and dynamic routes (those with URL parameters, eg /users/:userId)
- Access the values of URL parameters using React Router’s *useParams* hook
- Declaratively redirect users by rendering React Router’s *Redirect* component
- Imperatively redirect users by accessing the history object via the *useHistory* hook and calling its *goForward*, *goBack*, and *push* methods.
- Access the value of query parameters using React Router’s *useLocation* hook
